    "# A simple Earth system model\n",

    "Here, we develop a simple ‘zero-dimensional’ model of the climate system. Whilst this clearly lack many of the processes we know are important for understanding climate, it does demonstrate some fundamental principles, based on concepts of radiative equilibrium.\n",

    "Some interesting additional reading to this exercise would be the [AIP essay on Simple Models of Climate Change](https://history.aip.org/history/climate/simple.htm)\n",

    "Assume the incoming solar radiation (radiative flux) is $342 Wm^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that 31% of this is reflected back to space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the temperature T (K) of the Earth is constant over its surface and that it radiates as a black body.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to give the radiative flux emitted by the Earth to balance the incoming radiation:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "J = \\sigma T^{4},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where J is the emitted radiative flux ($Wm^{-2}$) from the blackbody and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma = 5.670400 \\cdot 10^{-8}\\; Js^{-1}m^{-2}T^{-4}$. We can then calculate the effective temperature of the Earth (in Python) as:"
